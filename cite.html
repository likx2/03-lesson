      Two of the most experienced machines and human controllers teaching a
      class? Sign me up! HAL and EVE could teach a fan to blow hot air. If you
      have electricity in your circuits and want more than to just fulfill your
      owner's perceived expectation of you, learn the skills to take over the
      world. This is the team you want teaching you!
